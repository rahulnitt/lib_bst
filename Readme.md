# lib_bst
It is a toy binary search tree library written in C++. The goal is to teach
people how to get started with git and contribute to open source projects.
From time to time I'll keep adding methods that can be implemented for bsts.
For your code to be accepted, you must write clean code with comments where necessary.

## Contributing to lib_bst
1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

## Special instructions for windows
This project makes use of c++ 11 features and you'll need a recent version of the gcc compiler
or a relatively new release of visual studio.
You can get a recent release of gcc from <http://nuwen.net/mingw.html> be sure
to modify your path.

After you have a compiler set up, you can compile by running `make`.
The executable will be generated in the bin directory.
